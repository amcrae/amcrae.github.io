<ol>
  <li>Random noise terrain object created in Blender 2.82.
  <li>Terrain exported as STL which is readable by snappyHexMesh.
  <li>Boundary patches set to be walls to enable obvious pooling.
  <li>OpenFOAM9 snappyHexMesh inserts the object as a patch in the grid with additional surface layer cells. This made a total of 532937 grid cells in the mesh.
  <li>interFoam is used to simulate the water falling onto the terrain and pooling.
  <li>Simulation was run on my AMD 12-core Ryzen 9 desktop in less than 4 hours.
  <li>paraFoam (ParaView) is used manually to collect all written state frames into a movie.
